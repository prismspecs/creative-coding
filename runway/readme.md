# Hands-on GAN workshop using RunwayML

In this workshop you’ll learn about how GANs work and then utilize a pre-trained Generator to produce new images and videos. Topics include: an introduction to neural networks; creative projects that utilize GANs; how Generative Adversarial Networks function; latent space; training a GAN (this will not happen from scratch due to time constraints, but you will be able to try this later on their own); using “inference” to generate new images; and creating videos that “walk” through the latent space of a GAN model.
