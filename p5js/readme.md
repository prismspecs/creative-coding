# Introduction to Creative Coding with P5.js

## Overview

+ What is P5.js?
	+ P5.js is a JavaScript library for artists and game designer. It's a community-driven open source project with good politics and a helpful community.

+ What will we learn?
	+ This short 2-hour workshop will introduce you to basic concepts in programming and interaction for the web. By the end of today's workshop, you will be able to draw shapes and colors to the screen using JavaScript, and have a better understanding of how programming works.


## Further watching/reading for self learning

+ The best resource for learning P5.js in my opinion is definitely the wonderful Dan Shiffman's YouTube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)


## Introduction

+ setup() and draw()
	+ Remember, "void setup()" happens once when the program launches, and "void draw()" happens over and over again forever in a loop after that

+ createCanvas()
	+ Something to draw to!
